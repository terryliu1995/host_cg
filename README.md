# CG for Games Final Project
## description:
In this project, I Implemented a skybox and a brick floor, as well as make my objects reflective and cast a shadow.
The brick floor terrain will use basic texture mapping, normal mapping and shadow mapping. What’s more, I also implemented a particle system (extra credit) to simulate rain effect.
## Directions:
Download the project from github. Then, because of the webgl version issue of and the cross origin issue, please open the index.html file with `Firefox` instead of Chrome and safari..
Scroll down and up to change the camera position.
Use key ‘W’, ‘S‘, ‘A’, ‘D’ to change the position of the bunny object.
## Claims:
My extra credit is to implement  a particle system to simulate rain effect.  My idea is to 
build this system by 4 layers of individual particle systems. Each layer is responsible for one area, and each area generate the particles with the different size and opacity, which makes our system more real. And then I also add the thunder sound feature.
## My assets:
Textures: Saint Peter church in Italy for skybox, brick floor.
Models: Stanford Bunny object and sphere
## Sounds: rain sound
